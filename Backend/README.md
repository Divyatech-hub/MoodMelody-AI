# Setup Frontend (ReactJS)

1. Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (Choose one of them) as main package manager

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Runs the app in the development mode.

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any logs, warnings, errors in the console.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

```bash
npm build
```

It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
